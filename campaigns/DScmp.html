            Well, a lot of things happened since our days. America has broken into pieces. UCA, United Cities of America, that's what they call it now.
            <br>
            The land is dangerous now. Terrorists, marauders, and so-called BT's, monsters that are dead but unable leave our world. Wellm yeah, basically ghosts.

            For various reasons, drones and other sorts of technologies are not anymore used for delivery, despite the critical circumstances. In these times, what people need the most is unity. That's where you step in. The UCA government has created the "chiral network", which allows people all across UCA to communicate without problems. What you need to do is to extend this network all the way to the other side of America and convince every estate to join it.
