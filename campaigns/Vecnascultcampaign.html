        <p class="par">
            People of Valencia just thoght they found peace under king Eddard's just and kind ruling. But then Joffrey came, Joffrey Baratheon, or, as everyone knew he actually was, Lannister. A ruthless, cruel spoiled child who knew nothing about ruling and was mostly told what to do by his mother Cercei, except for the very often occasions of his senseless and unfair executions, perverted executing was what that monster was good at, the one and only thing.
            <br>
            Then Vecna's followers came. They promised prosperity, they promised peace and safety, they promised to take that mad boy away. Through sacrifices of people. 
            <br>
            The darkness of the kingdom of Valencia is full of dangers both inside and outside of the cities even without the cultists. But they are growing stronger and won't stop until the bloody ritual is done.
            <br>
            It seems that the only last hope for the salvation are the six brave heroes, the names of whom were not kept in folk's memories, for they are searching to help people, not gain vainglory.
