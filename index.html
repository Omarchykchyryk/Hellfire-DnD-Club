    Welcome to our modest mansions, wherther you are a level 14 elf, or a level 3 dwarf!

    Now, there, of course, are some things to clarify. In case you're new here, you should know that, even though we call ourselves a "D&D club", it is far from the only thing we do. The genre is called "tabletop role-playing games", or TTRPG as we usually call it. Other than TRPG's, we also play traditional tabletop games, videogames, and watch stuff. Nerd club, if you will. 
    <br>
    Despite what people think, we really don't bite. We often throw introductory games for the newbies for them to see if that whole thing is really for them.
    <br>
    There are superstitions about what we do. Check out the <a href="history.html">History of TTRPG</a> if you'd like to know more about it and basically how out movement has developed.
