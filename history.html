<h1 class="hl">History of TTRPG</h1>
<p class="par">
Pre-1970s precursors, wargaming and narrative play 
<br>
The genre of tabletop role-playing games did not emerge out of nowhere. Its roots are considered to lie in two major traditions: miniature wargaming and storytelling games.
<br>
Somewhere in XIX, military strategists in Prussia developed Kriegsspiel, a tabletop war simulation with maps, dice, and rules to model real battles (sounds familiar huh).Iit introduced key mechanics later used in games (with another important detail — the referee who interprets results as they want) but was pretty predictably designed for training officers and thusly only used in studying with the big guys’ permission.
<br>
By the mid-XX, wargaming as a hobby became popular, especially in the USt and the UK. One of the first notable wargames created for everyone’s use was Chainmail, it allowed players to reenact historical or fantasy battles using miniature figures. These games focused on armies, not individuals. As you probably know, the key difference between, for example, D&D 3 and D&D 5e is that old redactions are all about numbers, and then 5e came out with its focus on role-playing.
<br>
I mean, narrative improvisation existed too, in some parallel forms: parlor games, radio drama, fantasy literature, and later science fiction fandom. People were already imagining characters and stories together. A collaboration just begged to be formed
<br>
The missing piece was individual agency, playing one character instead of commanding an army was not a thing back then.
</p>
<hr>
<h1 class="hl">The birth of TTRPGs with arrival of D&D</h1>
<br>
The true birth of tabletop role-playing games is universally dated to 1974, when the two legends Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson published Dungeons and Dragons.
<br>
Arneson experimented with a fantasy campaign called Blackmoor, where players controlled individual characters exploring dungeons rather than armies fighting wars. Gygax helped formalize these ideas into a published ruleset.
<br>
This was a massive conceptual leap. D&D was neither a board game nor a traditional story. It was both and people loved it, we still do.
<br>
Early D&D was rough, inconsistent, and often unclear, as you can imagine. Rules were scattered, ambiguous, and heavily dependent on interpretation. But that looseness also encouraged creativity and experimentation, that’s why we prefer the old redactions.
</p>
<hr>
<h1 class="hl">The golden era (late 1970s–1980s)</hl>
<br>
<p class="par">
Once D&D proved successful, the floodgates opened.
<br>
During the late 1970s and 1980s, new TTRPG appeared, expanding beyond medieval fantasy. Here are some of our favourite golden era games:
<br>
Traveller (1977) is about space and cosmic flights, Interstellar sort of thing.
<br>
Call of Cthulhu (1981). I mean, you gotta know it.
<br>
RuneQuest (1978) is written in mythological realism, skill-based mechanics, the nerds’ favourite.
<br>
GURPS (1986) is a universal system designed to run any genre. Sadly forgotten by now, but we like to come back to it sometimes.
<br>
This era also saw mechanical experimentation. At that time, designers questioned core assumptions:
<br>
</p>
<h1>Should characters gain power over time?</h1>
<p class="par">It’s funny to watch GE time’s designers ultimately just sending the level mechanic to hell. I mean they did good, that’s why we love it.</p>
<br>
<h1>Should combat be central?</h1>
<br>
<p class="par">At the end of GE the RP-based games started to emerge, but that will be talked about later.</p>
<br>
<h1>How lethal should the game be?</h1>
<p class="par">Call of Cthulhu just rejected heroic power fantasy. Characters were fragile, often doomed, and victory meant survival despite the rules, it was a genuine triumph for those who made it to the end. If you want to say something about that approach being stupid — come at me, smart-ass.
<br>
Culturally, TTRPGs became associated with “nerd” identity. This period also saw moral panic, particularly in the U.S., where D&D was falsely accused of promoting satanism or psychological harm. Remember ST S4? Well that’s kinda what it was like for us. Despite this weird whing thing the public awareness increased rapidly and soon enough we were fine. But yeah, still nerds.
</p>

<h1 class="hl">The rise of narrative and indie design in 1990s</h1>
<p class="par">
<br>
By the 1990s, TTRPGs began to shift focus from simulation and crunch toward story and theme.
<br>
One of the most influential releases was Vampire: The Masquerade in 1991. It emphasized the personal horror and moral conflict, social interaction over combat, deep lore and atmosphere. It does sound very interesting but we strongly advice that if you want to try out story-focused TTRP, you make hella sure you have a good GM and a good company with you. That’s the most important thing in these, obviously.
<br>
Players were encouraged to think of themselves as actors portraying characters, not just problem-solvers optimizing stats.
<br>
Around the same time, independent designers started questioning traditional power structures in games, particularly the absolute authority of the Game Master. This led to the shared narrative control which we value a lot in our club.
<br>
Games like Fiasco and Amber Diceless Roleplaying challenged dice-centric design, showing that randomness was not mandatory. So, yeah, it wasn’t even so much tabletop at some pont.
<br>
This period founded the indie movement, notably.
</p>

<h1 class="hl">The digital challenge in 2000s</h1>
<p class="par">
The early 2000s posed a serious challenge to TTRPGs. Video games and MMORPGs offered automated rules, visual immersion, there wasn’t even a need for a crew, that’s one of the main reasons you don’t see the likes of ours so often today.
<br>
You’d think tabletop RPGs would fade away, but they adapted.
<br>
D&D’s 3rd Edition came out in 2000 and introduced the Open Gaming License, allowing third-party creators to publish compatible content officially. This revitalized the ecosystem and influenced countless systems.
<br>
Meanwhile, smaller games doubled down on what digital games could not replicate: human improvisation. TTRPG survived not by competing with computers, but, quite the opposite, being unapologetically human.

<h1 class="hl">The Renaissance, modern movement</h1>
<p class="par">
<br>
Since 2010, lots of stuff happened. Streaming platforms appeared, the systems became really simplified and accessible (funny how your little brother can now easily play Pathfinder with you).
<br>
Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (2014) streamlined rules while emphasizing role-play and storytelling. It attracted new players who were less interested in complex math and more in narrative experience.
<br>
At the same time, systems like Powered by the Apocalypse and Blades in the Dark redefined design philosophy:
<br>
Rules exist to support the story, not restrict it.
<br>
Failure moves the narrative forward.
<br>
Characters are flawed by design.
<br>
TTRPGs also became a tool for education, therapy, and social development. Long story short, TTRPG today is nothing like what it was when it appeared first in the culture, whether it is good or bad — decide for yourself.
