            Our currently ongoing campaigns:
        </h1>
        <ul class="par">
            <li>
                <a href="campaigns/Vecnascultcampaign.html">Vecna's Cult</a>
                <p>The cultists who worship Vecna are planning on bringing it from the kingdom of the dead back to our world. The fate of humanity is now in hands of six adventurers, the six great heroes...
                    <br>
                    A hardcore high-level campaign for those who do not fear difficulties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="campaigns/DScmp.html">Death Stranding</a>
                <p>Once there was an explosion, a bang that gave rise to life as we know it. And then came the next explosion. An explosion that'll be our last.
                <br>
                A story-rich campaign by our God of Masters Kojima.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="campaigns/TWcmp.html">The Witchers</a>
                <p>Indeed, there is nothing more repulsive than these monsters that defy nature and are known by the name of witcher, as they are the offspring of foul sorcery and witchcraft. They are unscrupulous scoundrels without conscience and virtue, veritable creatures from hell capable only of taking lives...
                <br>
                One of our most brutal campaigns at this point. Leave it to our seasoned knuckleheads, seriously.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="campaigns/RDRcmp.html">Red, Dead, Redeemed</a>
                <p>"Revenge is a fool's game", that's what he used to say. But you felt different.
                <br>
                A private campaign that has a special place in our  hearts.
